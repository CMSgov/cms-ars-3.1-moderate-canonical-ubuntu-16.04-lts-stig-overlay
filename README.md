# cms-ars-3.1-moderate-canonical-ubuntu-16.04-lts-stig-overlay
(WIP) InSpec profile overlay to validate the secure configuration of Canonical Ubuntu 16.04 LTS against [DISA's](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/) Canonical Ubuntu 16.04 LTS STIG Version 1 Release 1 tailored for [CMS ARS 3.1](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-Technology/InformationSecurity/Info-Security-Library-Items/ARS-31-Publication.html) for CMS systems categories as Moderate.

## Getting Started  
It is intended and recommended that InSpec and this profile be run from a __"runner"__ host (such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop) against the target [ remotely over __ssh__].
    
__For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the _latest version_ of InSpec and supporting Ruby language components.__ 

Latest versions and installation options are available at the [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) site.

Git is required to download the latest InSpec profiles using the instructions below. Git can be downloaded from the [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) site. 

The following inputs must be configured in inspec.yml for the profile to run correctly. More information about InSpec inpputs can be found in the [InSpec Profile Documentation](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/profiles/).

## Running This Overlay
When the __"runner"__ host uses this profile overlay for the first time, follow these steps: 

```
mkdir profiles
cd profiles
git clone https://github.com/mitre/canonical-ubuntu-16.04-lts-stig-baseline.git
git clone https://github.cms.gov/ISPG/cms-ars-3.1-moderate-canonical-ubuntu-16.04-lts-stig-overlay.git
cd cms-ars-3.1-moderate-canonical-ubuntu-16.04-lts-stig-overlay
bundle install
cd ..
inspec exec cms-ars-3.1-moderate-canonical-ubuntu-16.04-lts-stig-overlay --input-file cms-ars-3.1-moderate-canonical-ubuntu-16.04-lts-stig-overlay/static-inputs.yml [-t ssh://<hostname>:<port> --sudo] --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>
```
For every successive run, follow these steps to always have the latest version of this overlay and dependent profiles:

```
cd profiles/canonical-ubuntu-16.04-lts-stig-baseline
git pull
cd ../cms-ars-3.1-moderate-canonical-ubuntu-16.04-lts-stig-overlay
git pull
bundle install
cd ..
inspec exec cms-ars-3.1-moderate-canonical-ubuntu-16.04-lts-stig-overlay --input-file cms-ars-3.1-moderate-canonical-ubuntu-16.04-lts-stig-overlay/static-inputs.yml [-t ssh://<hostname>:<port> --sudo] --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>
```

## Viewing the JSON Results

The JSON results output file can be loaded into __[heimdall-lite](https://mitre.github.io/heimdall-lite/)__ for a user-interactive, graphical view of the InSpec results. 

The JSON InSpec results file may also be loaded into a __[full heimdall server](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall)__, allowing for additional functionality such as to store and compare multiple profile runs.
